\section*{Overview}
This repository contains solutions to practical exercises focusing on machine learning models, covering both regression and classification techniques. The notebooks include model implementations, evaluations, and hyperparameter tuning.

\section*{Contents}
\subsection*{Practical1\_solved\_final.ipynb}
Implementation of regression models, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear Regression (Least Squares Method)
    \item Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
    \item Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)
    \item Polynomial Basis Expansion
    \item Hyperparameter tuning using k-fold cross-validation
    \item Learning curves for detecting overfitting/underfitting
    \item Dataset: Wine Quality dataset
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Practical2\_solved\_final.ipynb}
Comparison of generative and discriminative models, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Na√Øve Bayes Classifier (NBC)
    \item Logistic Regression
    \item Performance evaluation on multiple datasets
    \item Experimental reproduction of Ng \& Jordan (2001) paper findings
\end{itemize}

\section*{Key Skills Demonstrated}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Supervised Learning}: Implementing regression and classification models
    \item \textbf{Regularization Techniques}: Using Ridge and Lasso to prevent overfitting
    \item \textbf{Model Evaluation}: Applying k-fold cross-validation and learning curves
    \item \textbf{Generative vs. Discriminative Models}: Understanding fundamental differences
    \item \textbf{Python Programming}: Utilizing \texttt{scikit-learn}, \texttt{numpy}, and \texttt{matplotlib}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Usage}
The notebooks contain structured explanations, code, and visualizations, making them valuable for learning and understanding regression and classification models.

\section*{Future Updates}
This repository will be updated with additional practical exercises and model implementations over time.
